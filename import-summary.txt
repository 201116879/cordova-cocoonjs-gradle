ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ant.properties
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt
* resources/
* resources/cordova-ludei-framework.jar

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => webviewplus/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => webviewplus/src/main/assets/
* libs/LudeiChromium.jar => webviewplus/libs/LudeiChromium.jar
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libLudeiChromium.so => webviewplus/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libLudeiChromium.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libjsaiyan.so => webviewplus/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libjsaiyan.so
* libs/guava_javalib.jar => webviewplus/libs/guava_javalib.jar
* libs/jsr_305_javalib.jar => webviewplus/libs/jsr_305_javalib.jar
* res/ => webviewplus/src/main/res/
* src/ => webviewplus/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
